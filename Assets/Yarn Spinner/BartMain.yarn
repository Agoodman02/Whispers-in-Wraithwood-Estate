PLAYER: Have you seen Olivia?
BART: Who?
PLAYER: The other staff member who showed you to your room.
BART: Oh, yes.
PLAYER: What?
BART: I’ve seen that human.
PLAYER: Okay… so when did you last see her?
BART: I suppose when she was having to wriggle herself free from that troublesome dog.
PLAYER: You mean Max?
BART: Yes, he was nearly throwing himself on that woman right in front of us in the ballroom.
PLAYER: Did they go off together?
BART: Oh, goodness no. She was repulsed and did not hold back in vocalizing it. *He chuckles dryly.*

// after discovering Olivia has been killed
PLAYER: Olivia’s been killed. Do you know anything about that?
BART: I do not.
PLAYER: Really? Because there were fang marks on her neck. // BT-04-OL
BART: Not mine. I wouldn’t deign to shake a human’s hand, nonetheless bite one’s neck.
PLAYER: But you drink our blood?
BART: Solely from bags of donated blood and it’s not as if it is my choice. Humans are dirty, filthy animals that I try to keep a healthy distance from.
PLAYER: So who do you figure is responsible for the murder? // BT-05-OL
BART: Well she did have quite the run-in with that reprehensible ball of fur, Maxwell, when he tried to make a pass at her. I wouldn’t put it past him to have held a grudge.
BART: Not to mention the blood he had on him.
PLAYER: You saw blood on Max?
BART: Yes, after the meeting, I noticed him back in the ballroom with some of it on his arm.
