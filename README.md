# Whispters in Wraithwood estate
 
A mysterious group of monsters check in for their gathering at the Manor, unbeknownst to all that the night will take a sinister turn as a fellow employee goes missing. As a staff member, you’ve been tasked with uncovering the disappearance before it’s too late. Investigate the manor, find clues to fill your evidence board, and figure out the mysteries of Wraithwood Estate.

This game focuses heavily on its murder mystery narrative. It features gameplay of secrets hidden in an “open level” where each room and character has clues to unveil. The player wins once they have gathered the evidence necessary for the right character to be identified as the murderer and confronted.
